Scientific Question:
What are the genes that are being expressed differently in COVID patients versus none COVID patients and how are they different from individuals who were infected with COVID in the past but not anymore?

- It has been common knowledge that the body reacts differently after being infected, by expressing different geens to show what the infection is doing and how the body is combating it. After thorough research and investigations through many patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it was found that this virus was no different in that regards. Many genes are expressed differently. Host genetic factors, along with other risk factors may help determine susceptibility to respiratory tract infections. (Choudhary et al). 

- After finding more about the structure of neutrophils through Binding DB, a database that is focused on the interactions of proteins and their structures. http://www.bindingdb.org/rwd/jsp/dbsearch/PrimarySearch_ki.jsp?target=Neutrophil+elastase&tag=tg&kiunit=nM&icunit=nM&column=ki&submit=Search&energyterm=kJ%2Fmole

I would be specifically looking at the ELANE gene that encodes neutrophil elastase and other neutrophil-related genes that are functional in the upper airway. 
Scientific Hypothesis: 
If a patient presents COVID symptoms and tests positive for it, then the genes that are related to neutrophil-related transcripts will be expressed more prominently than a healthy patient who is not infected with COVID. 

- The fixation on neutrophil-related transcripts is fueled by the work of (Mick et al) and (Seyyed et al) as it showed how important the ELANE gene and DEFA1 gene are and how neutrophil contributes to combating SARS-CoV-2, although these articles gave contradicting results, it made me even more sure of my hypothesis that relates to the importance of neutrophil-related genes.

- I think that a lot of the neutrophil-related genes are upregulated in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but that doesn't necessarly mean that the neutrophil is active in the blood and tissue samples. I arrived at that hypothesis by simply looking at how effective the SARS-CoV-2 is at transmitting, which really gave me doubt about the effectiveness of the frontline defence systems of the body (neutrophils).
